The aim of this repo is to solve the openAI Taxi-v2 environment using Q-learning.

There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and the agent's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another.
The agent receives +20 points for a successful dropoff, and loses 1 point for every timestep it takes.
There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.
